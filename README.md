# Sales-Finance-Analytics-AtliQ Hardwares:

AtliQ Hardwares, facing challenges in optimizing net sales and improving net gross margins, undertook a data-driven transformation initiative involving deep sales and financial analytics. Through meticulous ETL processes and analysis of over half a million unorganized sales records, the company developed robust reporting tools and strategic insights.

Two key projects — Sales and Finance Analysis — played a pivotal role. These initiatives resulted in:

- Comprehensive customer and market performance evaluations
- Identification of critical sales patterns
- Improved tracking of essential KPIs
- Enhanced fiscal reporting segmented by time and markets.

These outcomes empowered AtliQ to make more informed decisions, determine optimal discounts, support global expansion strategies, and ultimately drive substantial improvements in sales performance and profitability.
